<h2 id="the-quick-version">THE QUICK VERSION</h2>
<p>We are committed to provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). It means we encourage respectful and tolerant behaviour towards everyone at the OHBM and SIG activities. Harassment of conference participants is not allowed in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, or other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

<h2 id="the-more-extended-version">THE MORE EXTENDED VERSION</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all event venues and online activities managed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) including the virtual meeting, afternoon and evening social events, and online content posted under OHBM hash tags. We expect our Code of Conduct to be honored by every member and/or participant of the OHBM community or person that formally or informally claims any affiliation with the OHBM.<br />
This code is not exhaustive or complete. We ask community members to adhere to it as much in spirit as in letter to create a safe and positive experience for all. We expect attendees and sponsors to follow these rules at the conference, hackathon venues, special interest group venues, poster sessions, and conference-related social events.</p>

If an attendee engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.<br />
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
We value your attendance. As such, conference staff will be happy to help participants or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.<br />
You will not be asked to confront anyone, and we will not reveal your identity. Your report will be treated confidentially and will be investigated to the best of our ability and we will take whatever action possible to prevent a recurrence.</p>

<h3 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h3>
<p>The Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) is an international community of researchers devoted to understanding the structure and function of the human brain, an incredibly complex and diverse entity. As an organization, OHBM strongly values diversity in its membership. OHBM is therefore committed to creating an equitable environment where human diversity is welcomed and respected. While no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honor diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.</p>

<h3 id="promoting-diversity">Promoting Diversity</h3>
<p>In both public and private interactions, OHBM expects its members to be respectful of all community voices. Conversations should be direct, constructive, and positive. We expect members to respect and honor all forms of diversity. Community members are also encouraged to seek diverse perspectives. As an organization, we will work to ensure that our leadership council, symposia and keynote speakers, committee members, and SIGs reflect the diversity of OHBM.</p>

<h3 id="appreciating-differences">Appreciating Differences</h3>
<p>OHBM members come from many cultures and backgrounds. We therefore expect community members to be respectful of different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. This includes being aware of preferred titles and pronouns, as well as using a respectful tone of voice.
While we do not assume OHBM members know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, we expect members to recognize and appreciate differences within our community. This means being open to learning from and educating others, as well as educating yourself.</p>
